# all-seeing Telegram Bot

A Telegram userbot that monitors your private chats and notifies you about **edited** and **deleted** messages — including media. Built on [TDLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib) via [aiotdlib](https://github.com/pylakey/aiotdlib), running as a regular user account with no Business subscription required.

> Fork of [Pfauberg/all-seeing-Telegram-bot](https://github.com/Pfauberg/all-seeing-Telegram-bot) — rewritten to use TDLib instead of the Telegram Business Bot API.

## 🏗️ How It Works

```
Your Telegram account (TDLib userbot)
        │
        │  updateNewMessage       → saves message + media to SQLite
        │  updateMessageEdited    → fetches new content, sends diff to you
        │  updateDeleteMessages   → retrieves saved copy, sends it to you
        ▼
  Notification Bot (aiogram)  →  your Telegram account
```

- **TDLib userbot** (`tdlib_userbot.py`) connects as *your* account and listens to all private chat events in real-time.
- **Notification bot** (`main.py`, aiogram) sends formatted alerts to your Telegram user ID.
- **SQLite** stores message history for 30 days (auto-cleaned at midnight).
- Both run concurrently in a single process via `asyncio.gather`.

## ⚙️ Setup

### Step 1 — Create a notification bot

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) → `/newbot`
2. Copy the **token**

### Step 2 — Get your Telegram API credentials

1. Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) → **API development tools**
2. Create an app → copy **App api_id** and **App api_hash**

### Step 3 — Get TDLib for your platform

**Windows:**
Download `tdjson.dll` from a prebuilt binary or build from source.
Place it anywhere and note the full path.

**macOS (Apple Silicon):**
```bash
brew install tdlib
# Library will be at: /opt/homebrew/lib/libtdjson.dylib
```

**macOS (Intel):**
```bash
brew install tdlib
# Library will be at: /usr/local/lib/libtdjson.dylib
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian example — or build from source
sudo apt install libtdjson-dev
# Library will be at: /usr/local/lib/libtdjson.so
```

### Step 4 — Configure

Copy `config.ini.exemple` → `config.ini` and fill in your values:

```ini
[telegram]
token   = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
user_id = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID"

[timezone]
name = "Europe/Moscow"   ; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

[settings]
language = "ru"          ; ru | en

[tdlib]
api_id      = "YOUR_API_ID"
api_hash    = "YOUR_API_HASH"
phone       = "+7XXXXXXXXXX"
password    = ""         ; 2FA password, leave empty if none
tdjson_path = "/opt/homebrew/lib/libtdjson.dylib"  ; path to tdjson library
```

> **How to find your user ID:** Send `/start` to your bot, or use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).

### Step 5 — Install and run

**Windows:**
```bat
run.bat
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

> **First run:** TDLib will ask for your phone number and the confirmation code from Telegram. The session is saved locally and reused on subsequent runs.
